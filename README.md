# PHP log site
A website with the normal HTML and CSS, but this time, we're spicing it up with PHP (and BASH!) and a way to track what time your site was viewed.
## Progress
Right now I only have the HTML, CSS, and BASH done, but no PHP. That will be coming soon.
## Usage
This actually is different. You can't upload it to Web Server for Chrome, rather, you could if you are a), have Linux enabled on Chrome OS, or b), are running it on something that has BASH, I think. I haven't tried.
