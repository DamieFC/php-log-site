# PHP log site
A website with the normal HTML and CSS, but this time, we're spicing it up with PHP and a way to track what time your site was viewed.
## Usage
You can upload it to a web server, my personal favorite is Web Server For Chrome, on the Chrome Web Store. It will all have to be put in one folder, and organized differently, but hey. Free website starter.
